### Generating Web Fonts

Open Sans fonts may be downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans:400,300,300italic,400italic,600,600italic,700,700italic,800,800italic) or it's [GitHub Project](https://github.com/google/fonts).

Upload your ttf files to Font Squirrel's [Web Font Generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator). Use default settings then download the generated zip file.

Copy the files generated by font squirrel to app/styles/fonts folder.

There will be a ```stylesheet.css``` file in the font folder. Copy and name the file stylesheet.scss.

Create a font path variable in the file ```app/styles/shared/fonts.scss```. Follow the pattern in the file.

To import the downloaded fonts into your theme, follow the pattern in app/styles/fonts/open-sans/stylesheets.scss to change the font path.
